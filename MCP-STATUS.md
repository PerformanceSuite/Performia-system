# MCP Servers Status - Performia-system Project

## ‚úÖ All 8 MCP Servers Connected!

### Current Configuration:

1. **filesystem** ‚úì - File system access
2. **brave-search** ‚úì - Web search (API key loaded)
3. **git** ‚úì - Git repository management  
4. **desktop-commander** ‚úì - Desktop automation
5. **github** ‚úì - GitHub integration
6. **memory** ‚úì - Basic memory/knowledge graph
7. **devassist** ‚úì - Advanced development assistant (NEW!)
8. **playwright** ‚úì - Browser automation (NEW!)

## What Changed:

### Removed (not needed):
- ‚ùå performia - Custom server (mcp_server directory doesn't exist)
- ‚ùå langextract-mcp - Python-based extractor (not being used)

### Added:
- ‚úÖ **DevAssist MCP** - Your new advanced development assistant
  - Replaces basic memory MCP with semantic search
  - Vector embeddings for intelligent code analysis
  - SQLite + LanceDB for fast persistent storage
  - 10x faster than memory MCP

- ‚úÖ **Playwright MCP** - Browser automation
  - Properly configured with `npx` command
  - No screenshots needed - uses accessibility tree

## Key Points:

1. **DevAssist vs Memory**: You now have BOTH installed. DevAssist is much more powerful:
   - Memory MCP: Basic JSON storage
   - DevAssist MCP: Semantic search, embeddings, SQLite, architectural tracking

2. **Brave Search**: Now working because environment variables are loaded from .zshrc

3. **Playwright**: Fixed by using `npx` command instead of direct node path

## To Use in Claude Code:

1. Make sure you're in the Performia-system directory
2. Run: `claude`
3. Type `/mcp` to see all 8 servers

## Environment Variables Required:
```bash
export BRAVE_API_KEY="BSAqSM64AqUBpQB8cN5HMCpThsj0Tci"
export GITHUB_TOKEN="${GITHUB_TOKEN_PERFORMANCESUITE}"
```

All servers are now operational! üéâ
