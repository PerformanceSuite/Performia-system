- Track sliders for each agent (Drums, Bass, Melody, Harmony, Listener)
- Mute and solo buttons for each track
- Dark theme matching the audio-controls folder styling
- Simple "PERFORMIA" logo at top left
- Collapsible side panels for advanced features

### Files Created/Modified

- Created new modern HTML structure with semantic layout
- Header with logo and test tone button
- Main container with collapsible sidebars
- Center content area with I/O meters and agent tracks
- Bottom status bar for system metrics
- Clean, organized structure using flexbox layout

#### 2. **gui/static/style_new.css**
- Implemented dark theme with CSS variables
- Color scheme: 
  - Background: #0a0a0a
  - Primary (cyan): #06b6d4
  - Accent colors for different states
- Gradient fills for audio meters
- Hover effects and transitions
- Custom styling for sliders and buttons
- Responsive layout with proper spacing

#### 3. **gui/static/main_new.js**
- WebSocket connection management
- Real-time meter updates at 10Hz
- Event handlers for all controls
- Keyboard shortcuts (Space for play/pause, T for test tone, 1-5 for agent mutes)
- Sidebar toggle functionality
- Audio level visualization with dB calculations
- State management for mute/solo buttons

#### 4. **gui/app.py**
- Updated Flask routes to serve new GUI by default
- Added new socket event handlers:
  - `test_tone`: Play test tone
  - `set_audio_driver`: Change audio driver
  - `set_sample_rate`: Update sample rate
  - `set_buffer_size`: Change buffer size
  - `mute_agent`: Mute/unmute agents
  - `solo_agent`: Solo/unsolo agents
  - `set_agent_volume`: Adjust agent volumes
  - `set_parameter`: Update performance parameters
  - `get_metrics`: Request system metrics
- Classic GUI preserved at `/classic` route

### GUI Features Implemented
✅ Test tone button with cyan accent
✅ Real-time I/O level meters with gradient visualization
✅ Audio driver selection dropdown
✅ Sample rate selector (44.1kHz, 48kHz, 96kHz, 192kHz)
✅ Buffer size selector (64, 128, 256, 512, 1024 samples)
✅ 5 agent tracks with vertical volume sliders
✅ Mute/Solo buttons with active state highlighting
✅ Collapsible sidebars with smooth animations
✅ Bottom status bar with latency, CPU, and memory metrics
✅ Dark theme with professional audio software aesthetic
✅ WebSocket real-time updates

## Part 2: Playwright MCP Installation and Configuration

### Initial Issue
User requested Playwright MCP installation. Initial attempt used incorrect configuration method (claude_mcp_config.json with npx commands).

### Resolution
User correctly identified that MCP servers should be configured like the other installed servers, using full paths to node and the package files.

### Installation Steps

1. **Package Installation**
   ```bash
   npm install -g @playwright/mcp
   ```
   - Installed version 0.0.35
   - Location: `/Users/danielconnolly/.nvm/versions/node/v20.19.4/lib/node_modules/@playwright/mcp/`

2. **Browser Installation**
   ```bash
   cd /Users/danielconnolly/.nvm/versions/node/v20.19.4/lib/node_modules/@playwright/mcp
   npx playwright install
   ```
   - Downloaded Chromium 140.0.7339.5 (129.6 MiB)
   - Downloaded Chromium Headless Shell (81.8 MiB)
   - Downloaded Firefox 141.0 (89.2 MiB)
   - Downloaded WebKit 26.0 (70.2 MiB)
   - Browsers cached in: `/Users/danielconnolly/Library/Caches/ms-playwright/`

3. **Configuration Update**
   Added to `/Users/danielconnolly/.config/claude/mcp_servers.json`:
   ```json
   "playwright": {
       "command": "/Users/danielconnolly/.nvm/versions/node/v20.19.4/bin/node",
       "args": [
           "/Users/danielconnolly/.nvm/versions/node/v20.19.4/lib/node_modules/@playwright/mcp/index.js"
       ],
       "description": "Browser automation with Playwright",
       "enabled": true
   }
   ```

4. **Cleanup**
   - Removed incorrect configuration from `claude_mcp_config.json`
   - Ensured consistency with other MCP server configurations

## System Status at Session End

### Running Services
- ✅ SuperCollider server (supernova) - Running at 96kHz with 512 sample buffer
- ✅ Performia backend - Python process with 5 agents active
- ✅ GUI server - Flask/SocketIO on port 5000
- ✅ SynthDefs - Auto-loaded successfully
- ✅ Audio interface - Quantum 2626 (18 channels I/O)

### Key Improvements Made
1. **Modern GUI** - Professional dark theme with real-time visualization
2. **Enhanced Controls** - Full mixing capabilities with mute/solo
3. **Better Organization** - Collapsible panels for advanced features
4. **Playwright MCP** - Browser automation capability added
5. **WebSocket Integration** - Real-time bidirectional communication

### Known Issues/Warnings
- Minor Werkzeug warning in Flask (allow_unsafe_werkzeug=True added)
- Some backend methods are stubs (need implementation for full functionality)
- SharedMemory import warning (needs fixing in memory module)

## Files Modified Summary

### GUI Files
- `gui/templates/index_new.html` - New modern interface
- `gui/static/style_new.css` - Dark theme styling
- `gui/static/main_new.js` - JavaScript functionality
- `gui/app.py` - Updated routes and socket handlers

### Configuration Files
- `/Users/danielconnolly/.config/claude/mcp_servers.json` - Added Playwright MCP
- `/Users/danielconnolly/.config/claude/claude_mcp_config.json` - Cleaned up

### System Files
- Multiple test runs of `run_performia.sh`
- SynthDef auto-loading confirmed working

## Next Steps Recommended

1. **Test New GUI** - Verify all controls work with actual audio processing
2. **Implement Backend Methods** - Wire up stub methods in PerformiaSystem class
3. **Fix SharedMemory Import** - Resolve the import warning in memory module
4. **Performance Testing** - Measure actual latency with new GUI
5. **Documentation Update** - Update main README with new GUI features
