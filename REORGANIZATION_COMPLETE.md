# Performia System - Reorganization Complete

## Summary of Changes

### ✅ Completed Tasks

1. **MCP Integration**
   - ✓ DevAssist MCP copied to PerformiaMCP
   - ✓ Renamed to Performia MCP in package.json
   - ✓ Removed DevAssist-specific files
   - ✓ Updated README for Performia context

2. **File Cleanup**
   - ✓ Removed duplicate synth definition files
   - ✓ Moved old backups to archive/
   - ✓ Deleted unnecessary test files
   - ✓ Removed DevAssist documentation

3. **New Scripts Created**
   - ✓ `start_mcp.sh` - Launches MCP server
   - ✓ `start_studio.sh` - Studio mode for learning
   - ✓ `start_live.sh` - Live performance mode

4. **Documentation Updates**
   - ✓ Created PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md
   - ✓ Updated main README with MCP features
   - ✓ Created comprehensive STATUS.md
   - ✓ Documented dual-mode architecture

```

### 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Pattern Recognition System**
   ```python
   # Priority 1: Implement in PerformiaMCP/src/patterns/
   - Vector embeddings (128-dim)
   - Suffix tree pattern detection
   - SIMD similarity matching
   ```

2. **Shared Memory Architecture**
   ```python
   # Priority 2: Implement in src/memory/
   - Lock-free ring buffer
   - Atomic operations
   - <0.1ms lookup guarantee
   ```

3. **Test with Real Music**
   ```bash
   # Priority 3: Proof of concept
   ./start_studio.sh
   # Play "Autumn Leaves"
   # Verify pattern extraction
   ```

### 🎯 Performance Goals

The system is now structured to achieve:
- Studio Mode: Learn patterns without latency constraints
- Live Mode: <8ms total latency using cached patterns
- Pattern matching: <0.1ms via shared memory

### 💡 Key Insight

The reorganization creates clear separation between:
- **Learning** (Studio Mode with MCP pattern extraction)
- **Performing** (Live Mode with pre-cached reflexes)

This dual-mode architecture enables AI musicians that both practice and perform, just like humans.
